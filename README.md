<h2> My first website - <em> brutalist style!</em></h2>

<p> <strong> What this project is: </strong> I have built a website with a recipe directory. Within each recipe link, I have created individual html files consisting of an unordered list, an ordered list, and attached an image. In order to display this information, I have utilized paragraph and heading tags. </p>

What skills I have demonstrated upon completing this:
<ul>
<li> HTML Boilerplate </li>
<li> Tags: paragraph, headings </li>
  <li> Lists: ordered, unordered </li>
  <li> Links: relative </li>
<li> Images: jpg </li>
  </ul>
