My first website - brutalist style!

What this project is: I have built a website with a recipe directory. Within each recipe link, I have created individual html files consisting of an unordered list, an ordered list, and attached an image. In order to display this information, I have utilized paragraph and heading tags.

What skills I have demonstrated upon completing this:

HTML Boilerplate
Tags: paragraph, headings
Lists: ordered, unordered
Links: relative
Images: jpg
